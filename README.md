# Space Invaders Reboot

## 1.0 Project Management Documentation

### 1.1 Project Aims
During this project I will aim to create a rebooted version of the classic game 'Space Invaders' that adds various new features such as multiplayer, powerups, and new enemies.

### 1.2 System Requirements
In order to complete this project, I will need access to the following:

##### Unity
I will be using Unity to develop my game as it can easily be used to develop for the PC platform which I plan to develop the game for. I also have a lot of past experience with Unity having used it to develop past projects.
##### Internet Access
I will need internet access to help me collect secondary research data through sources such as public reports and web articles, and my primary research as I plan to use online surveys to collect data. Additionally, web access can help me work more efficiently as I can save my work to the cloud and work from home as well as in class.
##### 

### 1.3 Cost
As I will be developing for PC and possibly Android, I won't need to purchase developers licences as these platforms can be developed for and launched on for free. The cost for a Unity Pro licence is $125 per month. This is where a considerable ammount of the money that is spent on this project will go. Realistically, to account for possible delays I would need to purchase atleast 3 months of Unity Pro to make sure that I complete the project, this puts my Unity costs at $375.

I will need a system that I can develop on from home. My PC is fully capable of running development software and meets Unity's system requirements by a considerable margain. The cost for my home system was $970, although the purchase was made several years ago, I believe it is still a relevent factor to be included in the cost of my project.

My home internet access costs $45.99 per month and is required for this project for the reasons stated in section 1.2.1. So assuming the project runs for 3 months I will include 4 months of internet access in the cost of the project for contingency incase of delays. This totals $183.96

All other software that I will need to create presentations and documentation is free (Microsoft Office, Google Docs ect.)

In total I put the cost of this projects development at $1528.96

### 1.4 Scope 
The game must stay close to the style and theme of the original Space Invaders while adding new features. Our new features should not change the way in which space invaders itself is played. They player must still have the same ovjective of destroying ships before they reach the ground.

We will be adding new ships with new abilities for the player to face, such as a ship that fires multiple shots at one, or ones that move faster than the others so must be taken out first. Despite this, no ships will add new objectives to the game or change the end goal for the player. Similarly, new powerups that the player can collect can change how the players ship behaves or how it fires, but will not change the fact that the player must stay on the bottom of the screen and defend against the invading ships.

### 1.6 Risks
The project runs several risks that could cause problems that would set back the project, they consist of the following:

##### Cost Management
The first risk to the project is one of cost. I could have underestiated the cost of something that I need to complete the project. This would undexpectedly drive up costs midway through the project and could stop the project completely if the money could not be found in time.

##### Illness/Emergency
Secondly, personal illness or an emergency personal matter could force me to take time away from the project and as the project had a fixed deadline
