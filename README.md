# CapstoneProject2-SpaceInvadersReboot

## 1.0 Project Management Documentation

### 1.1 Project Aims
During this project I will aim to create a rebooted version of the classic game 'Space Invaders' that adds various new features such as multiplayer, powerups, and new enemies.

### 1.2 System Requirements

#### 1.2.1 Development System Requirements
In order to complete this project, I will need access to a number of specific softwares and systems. 

##### Unity
I will be using Unity to develop my game as it can easily be used to develop for the PC platform which I plan to develop the game for. I also have a lot of past experience with Unity having used it to develop past projects.
##### Internet Access
I will need internet access to help me collect secondary research data through sources such as public reports and web articles, and my primary research as I plan to use online surveys to collect data. Additionally, web access can help me work more efficiently as I can save my work to the cloud and work from home as well as in class.

### 1.3 Cost
As I will be developing for PC and possibly Android, I won't need to purchase developers licences as these platforms can be developed for and launched on for free. The cost for a Unity Pro licence is $125 per month. This is where a considerable ammount of the money that is spent on this project will go
