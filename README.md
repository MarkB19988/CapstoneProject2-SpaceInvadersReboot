# CapstoneProject2-SpaceInvadersReboot

## 1.0 Project Management Documentation

### 1.1 Project Aims
During this project I will aim to create a rebooted version of the classic game 'Space Invaders' that adds various new features such as multiplayer, powerups, and new enemies.

### 1.2 System Requirements
In order to complete this project, I will need access to a number of specific softwares and systems. 

##### Unity
I will be using Unity to develop my game as it can easily be used to develop for the PC platform which I plan to develop the game for. I also have a lot of past experience with Unity having used it to develop past projects.
##### Internet Access
I will need internet access to help me collect secondary research data through sources such as public reports and web articles, and my primary research as I plan to use online surveys to collect data. Additionally, web access can help me work more efficiently as I can save my work to the cloud and work from home as well as in class.

### 1.3 Cost
As I will be developing for PC and possibly Android, I won't need to purchase developers licences as these platforms can be developed for and launched on for free. The cost for a Unity Pro licence is $125 per month. This is where a considerable ammount of the money that is spent on this project will go. Realistically, to account for possible delays I would need to purchase atleast 3 months of Unity Pro to make sure that I complete the project, this puts my Unity costs at $375.

I will need a system that I can develop on from home. My PC is fully capable of running development software and meets Unity's system requirements by a considerable margain. The cost for my home system was $970, although the purchase was made several years ago, I believe it is still a relevent factor to be included in the cost of my project.

My home internet access costs $45.99 per month and is required for this project for the reasons stated in section 1.2.1. So assuming the project runs for 3 months I will include 4 months of internet access in the cost of the project for contingency incase of delays. This totals $183.96

All other software that I will need to create presentations and documentation is free (Microsoft Office, Google Docs ect.)

In total I put the cost of this projects development at $1528.96
